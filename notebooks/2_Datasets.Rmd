## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Packages and Datasets
There are many built-in functions and data sets include in R, which is known as base R.

In addition to base R, additional packages can be downloaded, imported and used.

This markdown file will cover how to work with built-in data sets and imported packages.

The following chuck will open a window with a list of built-in data sets you can experiment with.

```{r}
data()
```

## Iris Dataset

For today's session we will begin by looking at a built-in data set, known as iris.

To see the data, simply run the command `iris` in a code chunk.
```{r}
iris
```
As shown, there are 5 columns and 150 rows.

When wrangling data, it is often best to start by getting a summary of the data.

To do so, run the next chunk.
```{r}
summary(iris)
```
R conveniently offers descriptive statistics for each numerical column.

For the `Species` column, a count of the categorical variables is returned.

From this, we can tell that the data represents 3 species of iris, with 50 examples of each.

### Selecting Data

To select a single row of data from the data set, use a square bracket`[rows, columns]` and specify 
the row number followed by a `,`.
```{r}
iris[1,]
```

To select a single column of data from the dataset, use the `$` symbol followed by
the name of the column of interest.
```{r}
iris$Petal.Length
```

Alternatively, you can use a square bracket and specify the column number after a `,`.
```{r}
iris[,3]
```

You can also combine these methods to specify rows and columns simultaneously. 
```{r}
iris[130:150, 1:3]
```

Selecting rows and columns by index (number) can be useful, but sometimes it more
convenient to use labels. Conditions can also be applied when sub-setting data.
```{r}
iris[iris$Species=="setosa", ]
```

In the above example, by leaving the space following the comma blank, it will
return all columns of data. 

You can specify columns to be returned as well. For example,
```{r}
iris[iris$Species=="setosa", c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")]
```

If you need a list of column names run the following command:
```{r}
colnames(iris)
```

## Vector math on datasets
The Basic_Commands.Rmd tutorial covered vector operations. You can apply those
examples to columns or rows of a data set.

Let's also introduce the `cat` command here. `cat` is used to concatenate info together.

Here we will concat our output to ensure the meaning is clear.

```{r}
column_of_interest = "Sepal.Length"
col_mean = mean(iris[,column_of_interest])
cat("The mean of the columm", column_of_interest, "is: ", col_mean)
```
To test, your knowledge, try the following:
  1. Update the above code to get the mean of another column.
  2. Apply a different function than the mean.
  3. Can you get summary stats for multiple columns at once?

## Base R Visualizations

Let's start with a histogram showing the values of Sepal Length in the Iris dataset.
```{r}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

Next, lets do a boxplot of Sepal Length by Iris type.

```{r}
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, iris, xlab = "Species", ylab = "Sepal Length")
```

The command `plot` will produce a scatterplot when given an two vectors (x and y).

```{r}
with(iris, plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
```

We can expand on this basic graph by adding colors for each species of iris in the dataset.

```{r}
with(iris, plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, main = "Sepal Length and Width by Species", type = "n"))
with(subset(iris, Species == "setosa"), points(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, col = "blue"))
with(subset(iris, Species == "virginica"), points(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, col = "red"))
with(subset(iris, Species == "versicolor"), points(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, col = "green"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red", "green"), legend = c("Setosa", "Virginica", "Versicolor"))
```


This concludes your introduction to using built-in data sets.
