# R_Intro_Winter_2023
Introduction to the R programming language for research scientists.

The lessons are separated into notebooks. Each notebook should be able to run as a stand-alone example.

However, the concepts build on each other from lesson to lesson. Therefore the following order
is suggested for running the notebooks.

1. 1_Basic_Commands.Rmd
1. 2_Datasets.Rmd
1. 3_Data_Manipulation.Rmd
1. 4_Data_Import_and_Export.Rmd
1. 5_Data_Visualizations.Rmd
1. 6_Data_Analysis.Rmd

The Introduction_to_R.pptx presentation has additional guidance on all notebooks.

The repo has the following directories to help organize material:
- notebooks
    + Where training notebooks should be stored
- data
    + Where all data files (csvs, excel and tab-delimited tables) should be stored
- images
    + Where all image files should be stored including those created by the notebooks
